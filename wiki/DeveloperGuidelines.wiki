= Initial setup of development environment=

See the wiki page [DG_InitialSetup Initial Setup].

= Running tests =

== Maven based tests ==

{{{
cd .../trunk
mvn clean install
}}}

*Note:* {{{mvn clean test}}} is actually sufficient but since the generator tests (see below) need the latest binaries in the local maven repository to run successfully {{{mvn clean install}}} is required anyhow.

== Generator tests ==

The generator is for now both tested and built manually using the built in support in Eclipse for building Eclipse-plugins.

Use Eclipse to run all tests in the project {{{soitoolkit-generator-plugin}}}.

=Continuous Integration=
The soi-toolkit project uses Hudson as its continuous integration server. 
Builds are performed after every commit to subversion and snapshots are published on a daily basis.
Hudson runs as a cloud service, see [https://soi-toolkit.ci.cloudbees.com/ Hudson@CloudBees].

= Publish snapshots =

To manually publish a snapshot of soi-toolkit do:
{{{
mvn clean deploy
mvn clean deploy -f commons/poms/mule-dependencies/mule-2.2.5-dependencies/pom.xml
mvn clean deploy -f commons/poms/mule-dependencies/mule-2.2.7-dependencies/pom.xml
mvn clean deploy -f commons/poms/mule-dependencies/mule-3.0.0-dependencies/pom.xml
}}}

Snapshot artifacts are deployed to the repository https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/soitoolkit

= Release handling =

See the wiki page [DG_ReleaseHandling Release Handling].

= Naming Conventions =

Version numbers:
 * {{{n.n.n}}} for releases
 * {{{soitoolkit-n.n.n}}} for svn tags of releases
 * {{{n.n.n-SNAPSHOT}}} for unreleased snapshots used during development
