|| http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/ConceptsAndDefinitions/SoftwareComponent.png || Software Component || A _Software Component_ is any type of software (e.g. system, web app, esb) that either consumes and/or produces services. A _Software Component_ is a coarse grained component, i.e. a system or web app and not a single program or class and typically consumer an/or produce more than one service. A _Software Component_ has its own CM-scope, i.e. its own release cycle. ||
|| http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/ConceptsAndDefinitions/IntegrationComponent.png || Integration Component || A _Software Component_ build using soi-toolkit is called an _Integration Component_ and contains a number of related services and that typically consumes a set of other services. ||
|| http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/ConceptsAndDefinitions/Producer.png || Producer || A _Software Component_ that publish a service is called its _Producer_ ||
|| http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/ConceptsAndDefinitions/Consumer.png || Consumer ||  A _Software Component_ that uses a service is called a _Consumer_ (of that service) ||
|| http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/ConceptsAndDefinitions/Message.png || Message || The actual _message_ (or payload) sent between the _consumer_ and _producer_ ||
|| http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/ConceptsAndDefinitions/Sychronous%20Request:Response%20Messages.png || Synchronous Request/Response Invocation || The _consumer_ send a request _message_ to the _producer_ and waits synchronously for a response _message_. ||
|| http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/ConceptsAndDefinitions/Asychronous%20Message.png || Asynchronous OneWay Invocation || The _consumer_ send a _message_ to the _producer_ and does not wait for the _producer_ to process the _message_. ||
|| http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/ConceptsAndDefinitions/Asychronous%20Response%20Message.png || Asynchronous OneWay Response Invocation || The _producer_ sends back a response _message_ to the _consumer_ and does not wait for the _consumer_ to process the _message_. ||
