=Introduction=

*Prerequisites:* For this tutorial is that the tutorial [TutorialCreateIntegrationComponent Create a new Integration Component] is completed.

This tutorial will help you to get started with creating a service that follows the [ConceptsAndDefinitions#Request/Response Request/Response Exchange Pattern], either synchronous:

and/or asynchronous:

The soi-toolkit generator helps you get started by generating the following for a new service:
 * A Mule service with:
  * Transformers for both the request and the response, transformers can either be based on Java or Smooks.
  * Proper error handling, both for error messages from the producer and capturing technical errors, such as timeouts.
  * Tracing, by default log-events are created when both a request and a response are received and when they are sent.  

 * jUnit based unit-tests for the transformers

 * jUnit based integration-tests for the Mule service
  * Including a test-consumer and a teststub for the producer.
  * Generated integration tests cover both a "happy days" scenario and negative tests (invalid input + timeout tests)

 * Configurable properties for settings that needs to be environment specific
  * E.g. for endpoint adresses and timeouts

The generated source code fiels are summarized by the following picture:

==Consumer support==

The soi-toolkit generator support synchronous consumers that either use SOAP or REST over HTTP.
If Mule is deployed in a servlet container, e.g. Tomcat or TCat, the HTTP connectivity can be delegated to the servlet container. 

Example of a consumer that communicates directly with Mule:

Example of a consumer that communicates with Mule via Tomcat:

==Producer support==

The soi-toolkit generator support both JMS based asynchronous producers and SOAP, REST or JDBC based synchronous producers.

Example of a asynchronous producer:

Example of a synchronous producer:

*NOTE*: For the time being the following features are not supported:
 * Smooks based transformers, since the smooks module not yet supports Mule 3.1
 * REST based consumers, only SOAP based, work is in progress.
 * JDBC based producers, only JMS and REST based, work is in progress.

=Create a request/response - service=

 * Select the menu "File --> New --> Other" and expand the wizard "SOI Toolkit Code Generator"
 * Select the code generator "Create a new service"

http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/TutorialCreateJmsToJmsService/TutorialCreateJmsToJmsService1.png

 * Click on the "Next >" button
 * The wizard "SOI Toolkit - Create a new service" opens up
  * Select the message exchange pattern "One Way"
  * Select the inbound transport "JMS"
  * Select the outbound transport "JMS"
  * Select your service project using the "Browse..." button, e.g. "/mySample-services"
  * Set a proper service-name, e.g. mySampleJmsService
  NOTE: In real usage, avoid using "{{{service}}}" in the name of the service since the actual Mule service will be suffixed with "{{{-service}}}", see the file list screenshot below,  {{{mySampleJmsService-service.xml}}}

http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/TutorialCreateJmsToJmsService/TutorialCreateJmsToJmsService2.png

 * Click on the "Finish" button
  * The wizard now starts to generate files and refresh the workspace.

 * When the wizard is done you can find the files for your new service in the Eclipse Package Explorer

 http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/TutorialCreateJmsToJmsService/TutorialCreateJmsToJmsService3.png

 * Files of interest:
  * Source folder {{{src/test/java}}}
  A new package is created for the service {{{org.sample.mysample.mysamplejmsservice}}} with two Java-classes.
  {{{MySampleJmsServiceTransformerTest.java}}} contains some unit tests for the transformer class that you can use as a start.
  {{{MySampleJmsServiceIntegrationTest.java}}} contains some integrations tests for the whole service that you can use as a start.
  {{{MySampleJmsServiceTestReceiver.java}}} contains a teststub receiver that you can use as a start.
  * Source folder {{{src/test/resources}}}
  The folder {{{teststub-services}}} contains the file {{{MySampleJmsService-teststub-service.xml}}} that is a teststub service that you can use as a start.
  * Source folder {{{src/main/java}}}
  A new package is created for the service {{{org.sample.mysample.mysamplejmsservice}}} with one Java-class.
  {{{MySampleJmsServiceTransformer.java}}} contains a sample transformation that you can use as a start.
  * Source folder {{{src/main/resources}}}
  The folder {{{services}}} contains the file {{{MySampleJmsService-service.xml}}} that contains the actual definition of the new service. 
  * Source folder {{{src/environment}}}
  The configuration file {{{mySample-config.properties}}} has got the following properties added:
 {{{
 # Properties for jms-service "mySampleJmsService"
 # TODO: Update to reflect your settings
 MYSAMPLEJMSSERVICE_IN_QUEUE=MYSAMPLE.MYSAMPLEJMSSERVICE.IN.QUEUE
 MYSAMPLEJMSSERVICE_OUT_QUEUE=MYSAMPLE.MYSAMPLEJMSSERVICE.OUT.QUEUE
 MYSAMPLEJMSSERVICE_DL_QUEUE=DLQ.MYSAMPLE.MYSAMPLEJMSSERVICE.IN.QUEUE
 }}}

 * Run unit tests
  * Right-click the test-class {{{MySampleJmsServiceIntegrationTest.java}}} and select "Run As" --> "JUnit Test"
  The tests runs and its success are reported in the JUnit view:

 http://soi-toolkit.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/Tutorials/TutorialCreateJmsToJmsService/TutorialCreateJmsToJmsService4.png

  The Console view displays at the same time log-messages from the execution:

  NOTE: Take a look at the unit test code and the transformer code for a better understanding on what is going on :-)

 * Run tests manually
 Sometimes just running unit tests are not sufficient so it is a good idea to know how to perform manual tests locally in your own PC.
  * NOTE: Requires that you have ActiveMQ installed separately and that it is started.
  See [InstallationGuide#Installing_Apache_ActiveMQ installation guide] for instructions.
  * Right-click on the test-server {{{MySampleMuleServer.java}}} in package {{{org/sample/mysample}}} in source folder {{{src/test/java}}} and select "Run As --> Java Application"
  * Go to the url {{{http://localhost:8161/admin/queues.jsp}}} in a web browser.
  * Write an ok test-message (e.g. "AAA") to the in-queue ({{{MYSAMPLE.MYSAMPLEJMSSERVICE.IN.QUEUE}}}) using the ActiveMQ console and watch the console output and the log + out-queue ({{{SOITOOLKIT.LOG.INFO}}} and {{{MYSAMPLE.MYSAMPLEJMSSERVICE.OUT.QUEUE}}})
  * Write a incorrect message (e.g. "ERROR") to the in-queue and review the console + queues.
  * Stop the mule server by giving focus to the console view in Eclipse and pressing the return key.
