= Deploying an Integration Component =

== Initial setup ==

=== Prepare an Integration Component for deploy using maven ===



=== Setup a directory structure for the Integration Component on the server ===

Create the following directory structure under the app-home folder on the server:
 
{{{
${app.home}
   ${artifactId}
      config
}}}

The directory structure will be used to hold configuration files, log-files and other files used by the Integration Components, e.g. archive for data files processed by the component.

*Note:*  ${app.home} is an environment variable pointing to the app-home folder on the server and ${artifactId} is the artifact-id of your Integration Component.

== Create deploy-files ==

Since we deploy to Tomcat the deploy-files are standard war-files. 
They are created with the command

{{{
cd .../trunk
mvn install 
}}}

The command creates war-files under the target folders of the war-projects...

== Setup configuration files ==

 # Copy files from src/main/environment to ${app.home}/${artifactId}/config
 # Perform nessecary configuration, i.e. change URL's in endpoints in the config-file, update username and passwords in the security-file and configure log4j to log to files in a appropriate way (e.g. rolling log-files)...
