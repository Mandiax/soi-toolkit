 Ensure that soi-toolkit can co-exist with Mule Studio and not interfering with it.

 Typically soi-toolkit can be used to generate good skeletons for pattern and test driven development of flow based services. Hopefully Mule Studio will be able to take on based on the generated code and allow the developer to enhance the code in a graphical environment.

Our progress depends on availability of the Mule Studio, hopefully we can get on the beta program...
