<wiki:toc max_depth="3" />

= Introduction =

Soitoolkit-nms provides a very simple api for accessing [http://activemq.apache.org Apache ActiveMQ] from an Microsoft .Net environment. It is based on [http://activemq.apache.org/nms/ Apache NMS] but provides a easier to use api focused on supporting the following exchange patterns:

 * Store & Forward (a.k.a One-way or Fire & Forget)
 * Asynchronous Request/Response
 * Publish/Subscribe

Soitoolkit-nms also provides:
 * *Logger*: A lightweight log-mechanism that can be configured to log to either the console, file or to Windows Event Log.
 * *Security*: Instructions on how to setup secure communication with ActiveMQ using SSL with mutual authentication.

s source code generators can be started either from the command prompt as Maven Goals or within Eclipse as a Wizard.

For information on how to use the _*Eclipse Wizard*_ see [Tutorials#Getting_started_tutorials Getting Started Tutorials]

For information on how to use the _*Maven Goals*_ from the command prompt, read on :-)

== Start the generators as Maven Goals ==

 * [UG_UsingGenerator_genIC Generate an Integration Component] 
 * [UG_UsingGenerator_genService Generate a Service]
 * [UG_UsingGenerator_genICTS Generate a Teststub Integration Component]

=== Setup ===
To be able to run the generators from the command prompt you only need Java SE and Maven to be installed (as describen in the [InstallationGuide Installation Guide]).

The generators can be launched with the command: 

{{{
mvn org.soitoolkit.tools.generator:soitoolkit-generator-maven-plugin:${version}:${generator-goal} -Darg1=value1 ...
}}}

E.g.:

{{{
mvn org.soitoolkit.tools.generator:soitoolkit-generator-maven-plugin:0.4.1:genIC -DoutDir=ic1
}}}

The generators can also be launched with a shorter command: 

{{{
mvn soitoolkit-generator:${generator-goal}
}}}

E.g.:

{{{
mvn soitoolkit-generator:genIC -DoutDir=ic1
}}}

The shorter command-form requires that you have specified the following Plugin Group in your Maven settings.xml-file: 

{{{
<pluginGroups>
  <pluginGroup>org.soitoolkit.tools.generator</pluginGroup>
</pluginGroups>
}}}
