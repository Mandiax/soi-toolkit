*BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY ISSUES:*

 * See [http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/MULEMIG/Home migration guides] from !MuleSoft regarding migration from Mule ESB 2.2.x to Mule ESB 3.x.

== soi-toolkit v0.3.1 ==
Release date: Feb 8 2011

This is a minor maintenance release with only a few small enhancements, see release notes here: [http://code.google.com/p/soi-toolkit/issues/list?can=1&q=label:Milestone-Release0.3.1 Release Notes]. 

The most important new feature is:

 * [http://code.google.com/p/soi-toolkit/issues/detail?id=87 Issue #87, Prepare soi-toolkit for Mule 3.x]

*BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY ISSUES:*

 * *Issue 87 and svn revision r693:*
 Added a MuleContext parameter to the public static methods `initEndpointDirectory()`, `getFilesInEndpoint()` and `getSftpFileContent()` to prepare for an upgrade to Mule 3.1. 
  * *Action required:* Calls to these methods must be updated. Since these methods only are called from mule-junit-test-classes a muleContext member variable already exists in the callers code (from its baseclass) and can simply be added to the method calls!

Trunk will now be branched into a MULE_2_2_BRANCH and future development on trunk will be focused on supporting Mule 3.x.
